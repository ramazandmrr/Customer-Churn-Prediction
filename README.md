### Customer Churn Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning. Customer churn refers to when customers discontinue their services with a company, and predicting this can help businesses retain customers by implementing targeted strategies. The project involves analyzing customer data, performing data preprocessing, and building a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn.

Objectives
Analyze customer data to understand patterns and trends related to churn.
Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a customer will churn.
Use insights from the model to help the company take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.
Dataset
The dataset contains information on 7,043 customers, including demographic details, services received, payment methods, and customer tenure. The target variable is Churn, which indicates whether a customer has discontinued the service (Yes/No). Key features include:

Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
PhoneService, InternetService, Contract
MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, tenure
Technologies Used
Python for data analysis and modeling.
Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing.
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-Learn for building machine learning models.
TensorFlow for deep learning approaches.
Flask for deploying the predictive model as an API.
Project Steps
Data Analysis: Understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: Process and enhance data to improve model performance.
Model Building: Train and evaluate various models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) to find the best-performing one.
Model Deployment: Deploy the final model to predict churn on new customer data and provide actionable insights.
Expected Outcome
A robust predictive model that helps the telecom company identify at-risk customers, allowing them to implement retention strategies and reduce churn rates.
